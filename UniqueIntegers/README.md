Write a function
` class Solution { public int[] UniqueIntegers(int N); `

that, given an integer N (1<=N<=100), retuan array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. The function can return any such array.

For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1,0,-3,2] or [-2,1,-4,5]. The answer [1,-1,1,3] would be incorrect (bceause value 1 occurs twice). Fo N=3 once of the possible answer is [-1,0,1] but there are many more correct answers).
