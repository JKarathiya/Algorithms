You are given a string S, in which one letter occurs twice. Every other letter occurs at most once.

Write a function
`  class Solution {public string solution{string S};}

which, given a string S, returns a single-character string: the letter that occurs twice. 

Example:
1. Given S = "aba", the function should return "a".
2. Given S = "zz", the function should return "z".
3. Given S = "bob", the function should return "b".

Assume that:
- the length of the string S is within the range [2..27];
- string S consists only of lowercase letters(a-z);
- all letters in S are distinct except one, which occurs twice.
