Please can you write a function which takes a string taht should contain a set of numbers and return them sorted in ascending numerical order in a string. Both the input and output strings should be space delimited. Upon error/exception please return the string "Error with sorting".

Make your code as succinct and robust as possible.

A number of tests will be run automatically when you click on the green Run button - add unit tests on the right if you feel that helps you.
